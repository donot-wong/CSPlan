		<Description>One of the SSL certificates used by your SSL server contains a public key less than 2048 bit long. [break][break]

New Standard for SSL Certificates Industry standards set by the Certification Authority/Browser (CA/B) Forum require that certificates issued after January 1, 2014 MUST be at least 2048-bit key length.1 As computer power increases, anything less than 2048-bit certificates are at risk of being compromised by hackers with sophisticated processing capabilities. The cybersecurity industry is moving to stronger 2048-bit encryption to help preserve internet security.</Description>
